 + ยน reading ide lines from readmes is supported for *cars*, *peds* and tunning parts in *objs* section _(i.e. vehicles.ide, peds.ide, veh_mods.ide)_
    

__Additional Notes__:
   * Decision files (.ped/.grp) mustbe in a *decision/allowed* directory to work
   * IDE and IPL that doesn't have a matching gta.dat are **NOT** loaded.
   * IDE and IPL files usually needs to be structured the same way as it's gta.dat demands.
      (i.e. IPL DATA/MAPS/TEST.IPL should be structured like modloader/My Map/data/maps/test.ipl)
      although this is **NOT** necessary anymore since Mod Loader 0.2.x
   * This makes the loading screen dynamic, removing the flickering when there are too few gta.dat entries (usually on TCs)
   * Matching for data lines in readme files are supported for some data files
   * This performs caching of the data files and readmes in the modloader directory, giving a better performance in
     not needing to merge data every time you load the game.
