[Priority]
; Defines plugins priority (which plugin should take care of a file first, events priority also)
; The priority should be between 1 and 100, where 100 overrides 1, additionally priority 0 makes be ignored (just like IgnoreMods)
; Default plugins normally have the priority in the range 45-55
;
; Just put the path to the plugin module, without extension and replacing slashes with a dot.
; For example:
;    gta3.std.text=0	; disables gta3/std.text.dll
